# BattleSheep

## What?

Attempting to create an implementation of the board game "Battle Sheep" in python.

## Why?

I played the game in a board game cafe, and it was kinda neat. I suggested that I could make an implementation of the game, since it's fairly simple, unfortunately other people heard me, and now I'm here.
