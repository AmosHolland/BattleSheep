# BattleSheep

## What?

Attempting to create an implementation of the board game "Battle Sheep" in python.

Battle sheep can be found here: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/54137/battle-sheep

## Why?

I played the game in a board game cafe, and it was kinda neat. I made the mistake of suggesting that I could probably write an implementation for the game, since it's fairly simple, and now I'm here
